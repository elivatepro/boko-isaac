## Overview

Quality Performance, an automotive protection film installation company, was struggling with manual spreadsheets, lost data, and no real-time visibility into their operations. They needed a complete digital transformation to manage installers, track installs, detect duplicate VINs, calculate pay, and automate dealership invoicing.

I designed and built a fully automated, role-based operational system that serves as their single source of truth—eliminating manual processes and enabling controlled growth.

## The Challenge

Quality Performance faced critical operational issues:

- **Manual Install Logging**: Installers tracked work on paper and spreadsheets, leading to lost data and errors
- **No Duplicate Detection**: The same vehicle could be billed multiple times without anyone knowing
- **Complex Pay Calculations**: Calculating installer pay manually was time-consuming and error-prone
- **Invoicing Chaos**: Dealership billing required hours of manual work each month
- **No Real-Time Visibility**: Management had no way to see current performance or financials
- **Scaling Problems**: Growth meant more chaos, not more revenue

## The Solution

I built a comprehensive operational platform with role-based access for installers, admins, dealerships, and owners. The system automates the entire workflow from install submission to invoice generation.

### Installer Mobile Application
- Secure login per installer
- VIN capture via scan, manual entry, or image-based decoding
- Stock number and product selection
- Photo capture for install and VIN verification
- Automatic timestamp and geolocation capture
- Duplicate VIN warning with escalation paths

### Duplicate VIN Detection System
- Real-time checks against full 17-digit VIN and last 8 digits
- Instant alerts when duplicates are detected
- Quality Control override path with confirmation, notes, and evidence
- Admin notifications for review and approval

### Admin Dashboard
- Centralized visibility into all installs and duplicate flags
- Filters by date, dealership, installer, and status
- Ability to review installs, resolve duplicates, and manage profiles
- Complete operational control in one place

### Installer Dashboard
- Month-to-date and year-to-date install counts
- Live calculated pay visibility
- Complete install history
- Designed for transparency and motivation

### Dealership Portal
- Secure access isolated per dealership
- View installs tied to their location
- See invoice summaries and download invoices
- Add Purchase Order numbers to installs

### Invoicing & Billing Engine
- Automated invoice generation from approved installs
- Multiple billing models: per unit, per car, flat rate
- Dealership-specific and new vs used pricing
- Monthly and custom date-range invoicing
- Downloadable reports and invoice records

## Technologies Used

- **Glide**: No-code platform for rapid application development
- **Google Sheets**: Backend database with structured data design
- **Custom Automation Logic**: Business rule implementation for pay calculations and billing
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure portals for installers, admins, dealerships, and owners
- **Automated Workflows**: Install validation, duplicate detection, and invoice generation

## Key Features

### Real-Time Install Tracking
Every install is captured with VIN, timestamp, geolocation, and photos. Data flows instantly to the central system, giving management complete visibility into field operations.

### Intelligent Duplicate Detection
The system checks every VIN against historical data, preventing double-billing and fraud. When duplicates are detected, a structured escalation path ensures proper handling with full documentation.

### Automated Pay Calculations
Installer compensation is calculated automatically based on install type, location, and business rules. Installers see their live earnings, creating transparency and motivation.

### One-Click Invoicing
Monthly invoicing that used to take hours now happens automatically. The system generates accurate invoices based on approved installs, with support for complex pricing models.

### Executive Dashboards
Owners see real-time metrics: total installs, revenue generated, payroll costs, and uninvoiced amounts. No more waiting for manual reports.

## Results & Impact

The transformation delivered immediate value:

- **Eliminated Manual Tracking**: All install data captured digitally at the source
- **Prevented Duplicate Billing**: Automated VIN detection catches issues before they become problems
- **Reduced Invoicing Time**: Monthly billing process reduced from hours to minutes
- **Real-Time Visibility**: Management sees current operations and financials instantly
- **Scalable Foundation**: System supports growth without adding administrative complexity
- **Single Source of Truth**: One platform replaces multiple spreadsheets and manual processes

## Long-Term Partnership

This project established an ongoing technical partnership. The system evolves alongside the business, with continuous support for:

- System maintenance and optimization
- Workflow adjustments as business rules evolve
- Pricing logic and billing rule updates
- Feature enhancements
- Access control and permissions management

## Key Takeaways

This project exemplifies my approach: **understand the business first, then build the right solution**.

- Discovery before development prevents building the wrong thing
- Role-based design ensures each user sees exactly what they need
- Automation eliminates errors and frees up human time for high-value work
- Systems thinking creates foundations for growth, not just solutions for today

Quality Performance now has operational control and visibility they never had before. What started as spreadsheet chaos is now a professional, scalable platform supporting their business growth.
