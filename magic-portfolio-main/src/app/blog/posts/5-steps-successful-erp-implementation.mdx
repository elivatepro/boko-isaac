I've seen ERP implementations go spectacularly right—and painfully wrong. After seven years and 70+ projects, the difference always comes down to the same five things.

Most businesses think ERP success is about picking the right software. It's not. It's about understanding your processes before you touch any technology.

Here's what actually works.

## 1. Map Your Processes First (Before Talking to Vendors)

**The Mistake**: Companies jump straight to vendor demos without understanding their own workflows.

**What Works**: Spend a week documenting current processes—not what the handbook says, but what actually happens. Shadow your team. Watch how data flows (or doesn't). Identify the workarounds people have created.

When I started the TradeFlex project, I spent the first week just observing. I found that their "official" process and reality were completely different. If I'd built what they described, it would have failed.

**Action Item**:
- Map out 3 critical workflows end-to-end
- Identify pain points, not just features you want
- Talk to the people doing the work, not just management

## 2. Start Small, Prove Value, Then Scale

**The Mistake**: Trying to implement everything at once across all departments.

**What Works**: Pick one high-impact area, implement it well, prove ROI, then expand.

For TradeFlex, we started with just inventory management at one warehouse. Once we cut their admin time from 6 hours to 45 minutes, the other warehouses were begging to get onboarded.

**Action Item**:
- Choose one measurable pain point (e.g., "reduce invoice processing time")
- Set a clear success metric
- Deploy to one team or location first
- Measure, refine, then roll out

## 3. Data Migration Is Where Projects Die

**The Mistake**: Underestimating how messy your data is.

**What Works**: Expect your data to be 50% worse than you think. Years of spreadsheets create:
- Duplicate entries with slightly different names
- Missing required fields
- Inconsistent formats
- Data that made sense to one person but confuses everyone else

I allocate 30% of project time just to data cleanup. It's not sexy, but it's essential.

**Action Item**:
- Export your current data and actually look at it
- Create data quality rules before migration
- Run a test migration with a small dataset
- Have a human review the migrated data

## 4. Train People on Why, Not Just How

**The Mistake**: "Here's a tutorial video, good luck."

**What Works**: People resist change when they don't understand the reason. I don't just show warehouse staff *how* to use the tablet—I explain *why* real-time updates prevent stockouts and save them from angry customer calls.

Training should answer:
- Why are we changing?
- What's in it for me?
- How does this make my job easier?

**Action Item**:
- Create role-specific training (warehouse staff needs different training than finance)
- Use real examples from their daily work
- Provide hands-on practice before go-live
- Be available for support during the first two weeks

## 5. Build for Humans, Not Perfect Systems

**The Mistake**: Designing workflows that are "theoretically optimal" but ignore human reality.

**What Works**: Your ERP should adapt to how people actually work, with room for the messiness of real business.

Example: I built an approval workflow where urgent invoices could skip certain steps with a reason code. The "perfect" system would require every approval. The practical system recognized that sometimes the CEO needs to approve a vendor payment at 11 PM.

**Action Item**:
- Include exception handling in workflows
- Make the system flexible enough for edge cases
- Don't eliminate all human judgment
- Test with the people who will actually use it

## The Reality Check

ERP implementation isn't a technology problem—it's a change management problem wrapped in software.

The technical part (configuring modules, setting up workflows, migrating data) is actually the easier half. The hard part is getting humans to change how they work.

That's why my discovery phase always starts with questions like:
- Who benefits from the current chaos? (Someone always does)
- What unofficial processes will people be reluctant to give up?
- Where will resistance come from?

## When to DIY vs. Hire Help

You can handle an ERP implementation yourself if:
- You have dedicated internal resources (not "someone doing this on top of their job")
- Your processes are relatively standard
- You're okay with a 6-12 month timeline
- You're comfortable with technical troubleshooting

Hire outside help if:
- You need it done in under 6 months
- Your workflows are complex or unique
- You've never done this before
- You want to avoid expensive mistakes

## Final Thoughts

Every failed ERP project I've rescued had the same problem: they focused on features instead of outcomes.

Don't ask "Does it have this feature?" Ask "Will this solve our actual problem?"

The best ERP is the one that gets used. Not the one with the most impressive demo.
