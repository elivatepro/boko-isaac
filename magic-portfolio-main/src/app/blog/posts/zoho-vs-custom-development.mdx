"Should we use Zoho or build custom?"

I get asked this weekly. After implementing both for 40+ businesses, here's the honest answer: **it depends on six specific factors.**

Here's the framework I use to recommend the right approach.

## The Decision Matrix

Answer these six questions:

### 1. How Unique Are Your Workflows?

**Use Zoho/Platform if**:
Your processes are 80%+ standard business operations:
- CRM with standard sales pipeline
- Inventory with basic warehouse management
- Invoice creation and payment tracking
- Project management with time tracking

**Build Custom if**:
Your competitive advantage depends on unique workflows:
- Proprietary algorithms for pricing
- Industry-specific compliance requirements
- Custom data models that don't map to standard objects
- Integration with specialized hardware/equipment

**Example**: TradeFlex needed inventory across three warehouses with standard approval workflows. That's textbook Zoho Inventory. A manufacturing client with custom job costing formulas tied to machine sensor data? That needed custom development.

### 2. What's Your Timeline?

**Use Zoho/Platform if**:
- You need it working in 4-12 weeks
- You want to iterate quickly based on feedback
- You can't afford development delays

**Build Custom if**:
- You can wait 3-6 months for MVP
- You have complex requirements that need planning
- You're building something mission-critical that must be perfect

**Reality Check**: Zoho implementation = 6-8 weeks. Custom app = 12-20 weeks minimum. Choose accordingly.

### 3. What's Your Budget?

Let's be specific about costs:

**Zoho One**:
- $57/user/month (all apps included)
- Implementation: $5,000-$25,000 depending on complexity
- **Total Year 1**: ~$10,000-$30,000 for a 5-person team

**Custom Development**:
- Development: $20,000-$100,000+ depending on scope
- Hosting: $50-$500/month
- Maintenance: $500-$2,000/month
- **Total Year 1**: ~$30,000-$120,000+

**The Crossover Point**: If your needs are simple, platforms are cheaper. If you need heavy customization on a platform (custom modules, extensive API work, complex workflows), custom development often costs the same or less long-term.

### 4. Do You Have Internal Technical Resources?

**Use Zoho/Platform if**:
- No developers on staff
- You want IT to manage it themselves
- You need minimal ongoing technical maintenance

**Build Custom if**:
- You have developers who can maintain it
- You want full control of your codebase
- You're comfortable managing hosting/infrastructure

**Hybrid Option**: Many of my clients use Zoho for CRM/accounting (things they don't want to maintain) and custom apps for their unique IP.

### 5. How Much Will You Grow?

**Use Zoho/Platform if**:
- 1-100 users
- Predictable scaling needs
- Standard business growth trajectory

**Build Custom if**:
- 100+ users (per-user pricing gets expensive)
- Extreme scale requirements (millions of transactions/day)
- Complex performance optimization needs

**Example**: At 100 users, Zoho One costs $68,400/year. A custom system with a one-time $50K build and $12K/year hosting becomes cheaper in year 2.

### 6. What's Your Exit Strategy?

**Use Zoho/Platform if**:
- You might sell the business (standard platforms add value)
- You want easy handoff to new team members
- You need third-party support available

**Build Custom if**:
- The software *is* your business
- You plan to license/resell the system
- You need complete ownership of IP

## Real-World Decision Examples

### Case 1: Trading Company (TradeFlex)
- **Workflows**: 80% standard (inventory, invoicing, CRM)
- **Timeline**: Needed working in 8 weeks
- **Budget**: $15,000
- **Team**: No technical staff
- **Decision**: Zoho One + custom Creator apps for unique inter-warehouse transfers
- **Outcome**: Live in 10 weeks, $16K total cost

### Case 2: Beauty Salon Chain (GlowBook)
- **Workflows**: Unique scheduling logic (staff specializations, service combinations, multi-location)
- **Timeline**: Could wait 12 weeks
- **Budget**: $40,000
- **Team**: Willing to hire developer for maintenance
- **Decision**: Custom Next.js app with Stripe and Twilio integrations
- **Outcome**: Exact solution they needed, owns the code, can white-label for other salons

### Case 3: Professional Services Firm
- **Workflows**: Mix of standard (CRM, invoicing) and unique (custom time tracking with client-specific billing rules)
- **Timeline**: Flexible
- **Budget**: $30,000
- **Team**: One part-time developer
- **Decision**: Hybrid - Zoho Books for accounting, Zoho CRM for contacts, custom Next.js app for time tracking
- **Outcome**: Best of both worlds - don't reinvent invoicing, but get exactly the time tracking they need

## The Hybrid Approach (Often the Best Answer)

Most businesses don't need to choose one or the other. Use platforms for commodity functions (accounting, email, basic CRM) and custom development for competitive advantages.

**Good Candidates for Hybrid**:
- Zoho CRM + Custom customer portal
- Zoho Books + Custom billing calculator
- Zoho Inventory + Custom manufacturing interface

This approach:
- Minimizes custom code you have to maintain
- Gives you flexibility where it matters
- Keeps costs reasonable

## Red Flags for Each Approach

**Don't Use Platforms When**:
- You're spending 50%+ of budget on customization
- You find yourself fighting the platform's structure
- You need features the platform will "never" support
- Per-user pricing becomes your biggest expense

**Don't Build Custom When**:
- You have no budget for ongoing maintenance
- Your requirements are still changing weekly
- You need it working next month
- It's not core to your business value

## My Recommendation Process

When a client asks me "Zoho or custom?", I walk through this:

1. **Document requirements** - what must it do?
2. **Prototype in Zoho** - can we make it work with low-code?
3. **Estimate custom build** - how much would scratch cost?
4. **Calculate 3-year TCO** - what's the real cost of each?
5. **Factor in maintenance** - who will support it?
6. **Decide or hybrid** - often the answer is "both"

## When I Recommend Each

**Zoho One** (60% of my clients):
- Growing businesses (5-50 employees)
- Standard operations with minor tweaks
- No technical team
- Need it working in weeks
- Budget under $20K

**Custom Development** (25% of my clients):
- Software is their product
- Truly unique workflows
- Scale requirements (100+ users or high volume)
- Budget over $30K
- Have technical resources

**Hybrid Approach** (15% of my clients):
- Complex businesses with mixed needs
- Want to own their IP but use proven tools
- Technical team but limited capacity
- Budget $20K-$50K

## The Question You Should Really Ask

Instead of "Platform or custom?", ask:

**"What's the minimum viable system that solves our actual problem?"**

Then build that—whether it's Zoho, custom, or both.

## Final Thoughts

The dirty secret: **most businesses don't need custom development.**

Their workflows aren't as unique as they think. Zoho (or similar platforms) can handle 80% of business operations beautifully. The remaining 20% can often be solved with Zoho Creator (low-code custom apps) or strategic integrations.

But when you truly need custom—when your software *is* your competitive advantage—platforms become expensive constraints.

Choose based on your actual needs, not what sounds more impressive.
